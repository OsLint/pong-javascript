# Pong Game

This is a simple implementation of the classic Pong game using HTML canvas and JavaScript.
Inspired by Marcin's Monskała Book "JavaScript from scratch".

## Gameplay

The game is played by two players, each controlling a paddle on opposite sides of the canvas. The objective is to hit the ball with the paddle and prevent it from reaching the player's side. The ball will bounce off the top and bottom walls as well as the paddles. When the ball passes the paddles and reaches a player's side, the opponent scores a point. The game continues until one player reaches a certain number of points, typically 10.

## Controls

- Player 1 (left paddle): 
  - Move Up: W key
  - Move Down: S key

- Player 2 (right paddle):
  - Move Up: Up Arrow key
  - Move Down: Down Arrow key

- Pause/Resume: B key

## Demo

To try the game, open the `index.html` file in a web browser. Use the controls mentioned above to move the paddles and hit the ball. Press the B key to pause or resume the game.
